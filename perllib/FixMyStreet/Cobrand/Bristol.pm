=head2 pin_colour

Bristol uses the following pin colours:

=item * grey: closed as 'not responsible'

=item * green: fixed or otherwise closed

=item * red: newly open

=item * yellow: any other open state

=cut

use constant ROADWORKS_CATEGORY => 'Inactive roadworks';

=head2 categories_restriction

Categories covering the Bristol area have a mixture of Open311 and Email send
methods. Bristol only want Open311 categories to be visible on their cobrand,
not the email categories from FMS.com. We've set up the Email categories with a
devolved send_method, so can identify Open311 categories as those which have a
blank send_method. Also National Highways categories have a blank send_method.
Additionally the special roadworks category should be shown.

=cut

sub categories_restriction {
    my ($self, $rs) = @_;
    return $rs->search( { -or => [
        'me.category' => ROADWORKS_CATEGORY, # Special new category
        'me.send_method' => undef, # Open311 categories
        'me.send_method' => '', # Open311 categories that have been edited in the admin
    ] } );
}

=head2 open311_config

Bristol's endpoint requires an email address, so flag to always send one (with
a fallback if one not provided).

=cut

sub open311_config {
    my ($self, $row, $h, $params, $contact) = @_;

    $params->{always_send_email} = 1;
    $params->{multi_photos} = 1;
}

sub open311_config_updates {
    my ($self, $params) = @_;
    $params->{multi_photos} = 1;
}

=head2 open311_contact_meta_override

We need to mark some of the attributes returned by Bristol's Open311 server
as hidden or server_set.

=cut

sub open311_contact_meta_override {
    my ($self, $service, $contact, $meta) = @_;

    my %server_set = (easting => 1, northing => 1);
    my %hidden_field = (usrn => 1, asset_id => 1);

        $_->{automated} = 'hidden_field' if $hidden_field{$_->{code}};
    }
}

=head2 post_report_sent

Bristol have a special Inactive roadworks category; any reports made in that
category are automatically closed, with an update with explanatory text added.

=cut

sub post_report_sent {
    my ($self, $problem) = @_;

    if ($problem->category eq ROADWORKS_CATEGORY) {
        $self->_post_report_sent_close($problem, 'report/new/roadworks_text.html');
    }
}

=head2 munge_overlapping_asset_bodies

Bristol take responsibility for some parks that are in North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

To make this work, the Bristol body is setup to cover North Somerset and South Gloucestershire
as well as Bristol. Then method decides which body or bodies to use based on the passed in bodies
and whether the report is in a park.
